# 🛒 Retail Sales ETL & KPI Dashboard Project

## 🚀 Project Summary

This end-to-end **ETL + KPI Dashboard project** simulates a real-world retail reporting pipeline.  
It transforms raw sales data using **Python (Pandas)** into business-ready KPIs and visualizes insights via **Power BI**.

The workflow mimics the kind of report automation and data transformation I delivered at Wipro — but using modern, self-coded tools.

## 📌 Key Business Goals

- 📥 Clean messy transactional data using Pandas
- 📊 Calculate KPIs: **Revenue, Profit, Margin, Units Sold**
- 🌍 Aggregate by **Region & Product Category**
- 📈 Visualize trends in **Power BI** dashboard

## 🧠 Real-World Use Case

> In my previous role at Wipro, we often worked with regional payroll and sales reports in Excel.  
> This project reflects how I could now **replace manual Excel work with automated ETL scripts + modern dashboards**, reducing time and human error.

It proves my ability to **build full-cycle reporting tools using Python**, exactly what’s needed in analyst/automation roles.
